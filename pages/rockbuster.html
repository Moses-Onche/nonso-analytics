                    sales volumes. Other significant competitors include Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision

                    Market Dynamics: Sales data from 2008 to 2016 indicates shifting trends, with North America 
                    and Europe showing declining sales, possibly due to market saturation or shifting consumer 
                    preferences. Japan’s market shows a preference for role-playing games, which can be a niche 
                    focus for GameCo.
